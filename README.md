# Blackjack-Simulation


Using a GUI create a realistic blackjack simulation


It involves handling several complex interactions between game logic, user interface/UI and the players actions.

Simple version for now, need to update to keep track of score and maybe add more decks to randomize to make it more realistic as to how you would play in a casino. For example hide one of the dealers cards to player before they hit/stand.

If I was to remake this code again I would use a more advanced gui than tkinter.
